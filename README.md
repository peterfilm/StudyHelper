A program for working with tutorials. Works in conjunction with KM Player. Use hotkeys to play videos (Num 5), rewind (Num 4) and forward (Num 6), without losing focus from the main place where you are working. Ability to work with one or two screens. 

If the checkbox is off, the player minimizes, returning you to your active window; 
if the checkbox is on, the video is not minimized, but focus returns to your active window.
